Oracle </br>
The oracle stays his young friend’s hand before she can poke the mound of muck and vines with her staff. They can ill afford another fight today. The woman pulls her staff away, leaving the shambling mound undisturbed.   
A sharp premonition swirls in the oracle’s milky white eyes. She whispers to her companions that they are walking into an ambush. The goblins only chance of success was a surprise attack. The goblin leader is the last to fall, wondering  how they knew.
The tiny girl’s timid voice takes on a commanding tone as the god of war speaks through her. Many will die on the battlefield today, she roars, but the victory will belong to us! The soldiers cheer, their courage bolstered by the oracle’s prediction. 
Oracles are unwilling conduits for the gods, vessels who channel power through their body and soul, but at a terrible price. Oracles are conscripted into service by the gods, much  a soldier is conscripted into an army, and as with a soldier, whose orders come down from the top, the oracle is often left in the dark, working toward ends they may not understand.
An oracle acts as an intermediary between the oracular god and those who seek their advice and prophecies. The gods speak through you but what they say is not always clear. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways. 
Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of likeminded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.
